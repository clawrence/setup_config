Concerned that eclipse and plugins are not from https site so man in middle and you have to manually
do checksum on files obtained to try and validate the published content.  There may not be certificates
to verify content.  So this allows big security holes.  Dito other needed windows software.


 Windows 
  Eclipse Oxygen
    has egit, has gradle plugins
  Git for Windows from git hub provides command line git option
  rpm files can be extracted as tar in linux distro
  there is eclipse zip editor plugin this so-so to view contents of rpm
  Pains:
    - egit have to re-type urls no memory
    - egit does not remember git source directory
    - egit odd that source is outside workspace on drive
    - egit does not seem to support blame
    - gradle default view does not show custom task
      (toolbar option  to enable showing under other)
    - output source such as TMP dir does not show up in eclipse by
      default.  To display it you have to add it as source and 
      in the build path.
    - Git for Windows does not have all git options like getting current branch
    - task run as definition to be able to click execution tasks, use
      Window -> Show View -> Other -> Gradle -> Gradle Tasks
    - sometimes hangs after viewing rpm and have to close before gradle runs
    - sometimes restart eclipse and then all is well.
    - import git project to get source
  Hacks:
    gradle: isWindows = org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem.current().windows
    gradle: run_command.execute().text.replace("*","").trim()
    gradle: "cmd /c cd ${projectDir}/${name} && git branch | findstr /b \"* \""
    gradle  "git --git-dir=${name}.git --work-tree=#{name} rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD"
    gradle: asset( proj_branch == build_branch)
    gradle: println()
