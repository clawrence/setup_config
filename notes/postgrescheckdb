Investigated how to check if sql is running with a certain db:

Found a function that would do it commented below.

Yet, in spring boot the $$ parsing does not work so you have
to use ' and then '' inside the quotes rather than $$ parsing
or it messes up the parsing.

/*
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.junk (
  id bigint,
  nums int,
  strs varchar
);
 */

/*
DO
$do$
BEGIN
IF (select current_database() = 'cowdb') THEN
  INSERT INTO public.junk VALUES (1,99,'jj'); \
END IF; \
END
$do$;
  */
/*
*/

/* below I think worked.... to do insert only when matches db 
   in data.sql */

DO ' BEGIN IF (select current_database() = ''goatdb'') THEN INSERT INTO public.junk VALUES (1,77, ''now from if statement''); END IF; END';
