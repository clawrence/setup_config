aws audit checking for security  

(http://summitroute.com/blog/2017/05/30/free_tools_for_auditing_the_security_of_an_aws_account/)

Possibly Really Bad:
  Secuirty Group is open to 0.0.0.0/0
  S3 Bucket is World readable


How to collect info:
1) AWS API calls to get current state
2) Monitor CloudTrail (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) logs and alerts
   when potentially concerning changes are made
3) Use AWS config (hettp://aws.amazon.com/config/) logs to undertand 
how an account currently exists.


Available Tools:
  AWS Trusted Advisor (free with account, pay for better)
  AWS Config  (tracks change history and provides sns notifications)
  Scout2 (opensource 2014)
  Prowler (githubcom/Alfresco/prowler)
  Security Monkey (netflix github.com/Netflix/secuirty_monkey 2014 AWS and google cloud platform GCP Needs its own EC2 and Postgresql backend)
  Cloud Custodian   ????

on aws:
seems like aws has route to pull info that is sort of
like ip not used.. similar to rfc-1918 addresses stuff.
169.254.169.254 url can get local ipv4 address
maybe 253 is dns
maybe 123 is ntp?

start up scripts may need to bind?
