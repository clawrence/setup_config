  NAT vs Proxy
    NAT: routers, firewalls [ linux, cisco ]
    applications are not aware of it, no client side configuration
  Forward Proxy
    corporate uses to cache and filter
    client goes to proxy who decides if it is allowed
    enforce internet access and data security policies
    can be used on internet to make request appear to come from elsewhere
  Transparent Proxy
    client applications are not aware of them
    router/firewall sends reqeust to software proxy application its running
    such as squid before they go to internet.
  Reverse Proxy
    used to load balance and protect inside web servers from outside
    hosts.  an insecure platform can set up secure apache reverse proxy
    and use that to alloc internet access to web servers.  Cisco
    makes ACE to allow high end switches and routers to run reverse
    proxies.

Security Ideas:  think of real world and then consider equivalents
in cloud.

SAFE:
  feeling vs reality
TRUST:
  wise vs foolish
SECURE CASINO
 video watching everything looks unprotected
 hidden security all over may interact with people
SECURE BANK

SECURE HOUSE:
  hidden keys
  lights/bushes
  locked doors/windows
  look before open the door
SECURE CAR:
  choice of car driven
  keep valuables out of sight
  location park
  locked doors/windows up
  alarm system
